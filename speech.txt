On weekdays I usually get up at twenty past seven, on Sundays I always have a lie-in and I don't get out of bed until 11 or 12 in the morning. I'm afraid of oversleeping, so I get up immediately after my alarm clock goes off. I'm always in a hurry in the mornings, that's why I never have time for my breakfast. At the weekends my daily routine is different: I don't have to get up early, so I always stay in bed longer and I get up around 11. After I usually take a shower. 


Twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays, I go to wing-tsung Kung-Fu training from 18.30 to 20.00. When I get home, I have a snack andt then I do my homework. It takes me about one or two hours to get ready for the next day. I go home and have lunch with my mum and my father. After lunch  I relax for a while, I have a snooze and I check my emails on my computer.
I have dinner with my family at 7 o'clock, after that I usually switch on my computer, and I usually code in Python or HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language). In fact, that's one of the most enjoyable parts of my day. After I usually surf the Internet or play my favourite computer games. I go to bed at 11 o'clock.
We usually watch a DVD together or have a chat each other.
 At the weekend I always get ut late, around eleven o'clock. I usually tidy my room and help my mum wiht some housework on Saturday afternoon.
 On Sundays I relax a lot, read a book and surf the Internet. In the afternoon I do my homework. 
 I usually listen to music or surf the Internet then.
 I often play board games or cards with my family, or when the weather is nice we go for a walk in the local forest.
 What 'is your  hobby?
 As I'm a teenager, my daily routine is pretty ordinary.
